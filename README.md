# Greece-WebMap ðŸ—º

## Info
This repository contains a Python script which generates via Folium library an interactive WebMAP of Greece.  

I used some sample data to demonstrate
- Volcanoes
- Ports
- Mountains

across the Greece.

The points on the map are interactive and you can click on them to display some valuable information.

There is also a layer control, in which you can choose what do you want to be displayed on the map.
The layer control is located top right on your screen.
